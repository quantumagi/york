ETHOS
  • Dependency results are only imported from upstream scripts, to avoid 
    circularity, and not hard-coded in this script.
  • Explicit constants, ratios and formulas are documented from pre-existing
    theory, substantiated, and contextually appropriate at the point of usage.

WHAT THIS CERTIFIES
  Compute the mid-edge parity/Jacobian quotient γ_edge for the protocol by
  deriving it from the finite abelian parity group G ≅ (Z₂)^4 via explicit
  character projection. No numeric value is hard-coded; γ_edge emerges as an
  exact rational from the group structure.

INPUTS
  (none — producer script; derives γ_edge by explicit group/character algebra)

DERIVATION (no (a,b))
  1) Mid-edge parity group:
       G ≅ (Z₂)^4 with |G| = 16. Its one–dimensional irreducible characters
       form a group isomorphic to G. Pick any nontrivial character χ_odd.

  2) Character orthogonality (pre-existing finite group theory):
       |G|⁻¹ ∑_{g∈G} χ_odd(g) = 0
     so the uniform projector onto χ_odd is orthogonal to the trivial
     (even) sector.

  3) Quotient action:
       Removing exactly the χ_odd line while retaining all other sectors
       yields a multiplicative factor on the even content
         γ_edge = (|G| − 1) / |G| = 15/16.
     This is independent of which nontrivial χ_odd is chosen.
